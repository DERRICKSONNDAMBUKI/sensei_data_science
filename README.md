### Numpy
The NumPy module allows us to efficiently work with vectors, matrices and multi-dimensional arrays. It is crucial for linear algebra and numerical analysis.

### Scipy
NumPy is basically just managing the arrays and lists. It is responsible for the operations like indexing, sorting, slicing, reshaping and so on. Now, SciPy actually uses NumPy to offer more abstract classes and functions that solve scientific problems.

### Matplotlib
This library is responsible for plotting graphs and visualizing our data. It offers numerous types of plotting, styles and graphs.

Visualization is a key step in data science.

### Pandas
It offers us a powerful data structure named data frame . You can imagine it to be a bit like a mix of an Excel table and an SQL database table.

### Libraries needed in Data science
pip install numpy
pip install scipy (optional)
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas

NUMPY ARRAY ATTRIBUTES
ATTRIBUTE   DESCRIPTION
a.shape     Returns the shape of the array
            e.g. (3,3) or (3,4,7)

a.ndim      Returns how many dimensions our
            array has

a.size      Returns the amount of elements an
            array has

a.dtype     Returns the data type of the values in
            the array

NUMPY MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS
FUNCTION    DESCRIPTION
np.exp(a)   Takes e to the power of each value
np.sin(a)   Returns the sine of each value
np.cos(a)   Returns the cosine of each value
np.tan(a)   Returns the tangent of each value
np.log(a)   Returns the logarithm of each value
np.sqrt(a)  Returns the square root of each value
